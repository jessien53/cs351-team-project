# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods

**Problem 2:People amy want to be more mindful about environmental impact but may not know how to best apporach it**

**Solution 2: Creating a app that scans food labels and gives a rating on the carbon foorprint. This would keep you eco-conscious about the impact a certain product has on the environment.**

**Problem 3: There is no existing platform for students to advertise for goods and services that they could provide other students in their college commmunity with.**

**Solution 3: We could create a platform where students can advertise their goods and services, others can review them, and transactions can be made. There can be communities and sub-communities created to cater to people in certain domains.**

# Track 3: Creative Coding and Cultural Expression

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 4:**
People listen to music and recognize samples or instrumentation from different cultures in the songs. An app that takes a song and provides a flavor profile of the cultures it was inspired by or it has taken samples or instrumentation from.

**Implementation 4:**
A website using React and Django where people upload an audio file and we use some sort of API to take apart the audio and dissect each part to identify the influences then return a visiualization of the influences.

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 5:**
There is a certain beauty to the seemingly random events in a computer that end up in errorrs, like photo courruption.
**Implementation 5:**
You could create a website where you could pursposly corrupt videos or photos, and will add visual artifacts like pixelation or gray boxes, and incomplete images
